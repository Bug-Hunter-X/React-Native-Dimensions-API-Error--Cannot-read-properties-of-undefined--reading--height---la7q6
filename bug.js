This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The `Dimensions` API returns an object with `width` and `height` properties. However, if you try to access these properties before the component has fully mounted, you'll encounter this error.  This is especially problematic in asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API before screen dimensions are available.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Dimensions, View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [screenHeight, setScreenHeight] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const { height } = Dimensions.get('window');
    setScreenHeight(height);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Screen Height: {screenHeight}</Text> 
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
